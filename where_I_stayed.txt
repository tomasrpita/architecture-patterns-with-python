This is a note for whwre i stayed in the book

Chapter 6: Unit of Work Pattern Exercise
Part: End of Chapter

Define "FLASK_APP": "src/allocation/entrypoints/flask_app.py" to test

To-do:
	The test_apy, erroneously loads the early batch, when it should
	load the laterbatch, and this is a case of domain that is already
	proven in their respective tests, why here it does not work well?


	
	With an approach to using @contextmanager, but all the tests don't work for 
	me at all, maybe I'll get back to it later...
