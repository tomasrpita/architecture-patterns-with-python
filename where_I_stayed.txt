Chapter: 4: Our First Use Case: Flask API and Service Layer
Part: Exercise for the Reader

To-do:

	The test_apy, test_happy_path_returns_201_and_allocated_batch,
    erroneously loads the early batch, when it should lo proven in their
    respective tests, why here it does not work well?

    Now that we have an allocate service, why not build out a service for deallocate?
    We’ve added an E2E test and a few stub service-layer tests for you to get started
    on GitHub.

    If that’s not enough, continue into the E2E tests and flask_app.py, and
    refactor the Flask adapter to be more RESTful. Notice how doing so doesn’t
    require any change to our service layer or domain layer!

    Set Intructios for run flask and postgres in local while running the tests
    and docker is not available in the local machine.
